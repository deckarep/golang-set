// Package mapset implements a simple and  set collection.
// Items stored within it are unordered and unique. It supports
// typical set operations: membership testing, intersection, union,
// difference, symmetric difference and cloning.
//
// Package mapset provides two implementations of the Set
// interface. The default implementation is safe for concurrent
// access, but a non-thread-safe implementation is also provided for
// programs that can benefit from the slight speed improvement and
// that can enforce mutual exclusion through other means.

// represents an unordered set of data and a large number of
// operations that can be applied to that set.
